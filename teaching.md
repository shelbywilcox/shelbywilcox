My teaching experiences have led me to realize the importance of developing a thorough teaching philosophy. The most effective way to engage students in the classroom is through a student-centered approach. To me, that means understanding what their expectations are, what they value, and how content I teach can impact their lives beyond the classroom. In example, I like to ask student's about media they consume to develop more diverse pop culture examples. I also ask students about social causes they care about and develop examples around those causes to make material engaging. 

Flexible deadlines, emphasising qualitative feedback, encouraging vulnerability and risk-taking in their work, and demonstrating mindfulness are some of the ways I practice my student-centered approach. Putting the students’ needs and expectations first allows me to provide more engaging, diverse lectures while also empowering students to be more active in their participation. 

Being responsive and open-minded to student’s needs has helped my students to enjoy the course more. Their enjoyment is made evident through their positive end-of-semester evaulations from my class. Furthermore, students I have taught have gone on to win awards in my department, even referencing their experiences in my class as a reason they love communication as a major. 

These experiences have been rewarding and I plan to continue improving my teaching by prioritize creating more inclusive environments and curriculums, and supporting students in their academic pursuits.
