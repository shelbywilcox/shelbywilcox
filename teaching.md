My teaching experiences have led me to realize the importance of developing a thorough teaching philosophy, and how prioritizing my teaching philosphy enables me to be a more effective researcher and colleague. The most effective way to engage students in the classroom is through a student-centered approach. To me, that means understanding what their expectations are, what they value, and how content I teach can impact their lives beyond the classroom. In example, I like to ask student's about media they consume to develop more diverse pop culture examples. I also ask students about social causes they care about and develop examples around those causes to make material engaging. 

Flexible deadlines, emphasising qualitative feedback, encouraging vulnerability and risk-taking in their work, and demonstrating mindfulness are some of the ways I practice my student-centered approach. Putting the students’ needs and expectations first allows me to provide more engaging, diverse lectures while also empowering students to be more active in their participation. 

Being responsive and open-minded to student’s needs has helped my students to enjoy the course more. Their enjoyment is made evident through their positive end-of-semester evaulations from my class. Students I have taught have gone on to win awards in my department, even referencing their experiences in my class as a reason they love communication as a major. One of my other points of teaching related pride is that I have written 4 letters of recommendation for students going on to graduate school, and several more letters in support of students applying to various scholarships. 

These experiences have been rewarding and I plan to continue improving my teaching by creating more inclusive environments and curriculums, and supporting students in their academic pursuits.

### Resources I've used for decolonizing my classroom ###
These are some resources that have helped me re-think what an inclusive classroom means and my role in creating that space. First and foremost, decolonizing means
land back. Land back and classroom inclusiveness is particularly poignant at land-grant universities like MSU. To better understand the role that land grant
universities continue to play in colonization, please see the Land Grab project here: [https://www.landgrabu.org/](https://www.landgrabu.org/)

### Student Feedback ###
2021

"I really appreciate how much help you have given us students in our recitation to ensure our academic sucess. Thank you so much for being so fluid and communicative especially through this very hectic past couple of weeks. I really enjoyed having you as a TA and I appreciate all your efforts you made for our class. Again, thank you for all that you do!"

"Thank you for being such a great TA this last semester and for making me enjoy coming to your class once a week! I really was dreading taking this class but you made it so enjoyable and a safe place to learn and make mistakes."

"I would like to thank you for all you did this semester and showing up every day to teach us. Although I was the quiet kid in the class, I actually enjoyed coming to your class because you made learning easy. You said it was your first year teaching [this] class, which you did great, you have a teaching style that's timeless. My friend and I said after the last class that you're gonna be the cool professor, if that's what you plan to do, which you should."
