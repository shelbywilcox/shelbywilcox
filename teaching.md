### Philosophy 
My philosophy in the classroom is to practice a student-centered approach. To me, that means understanding what their expectations are, what they value, and how content I teach can impact their lives beyond the classroom. This starts with me respecting their time and work, and meeting them where they are without compromising learning objectives for the course. I make my courses highly adaptable to meet the needs of each class. On every topic, there exists much more information than I can convey to students in one semester. Thus, I take my expertise on a broad range of topics and distill down that content to be most relevant to what students need. In the classroom, I see myself as a learner and structure class time so that my lecture time is minimized so students can engage in learning hands on and discuss materials. I provide feedback and guide discussions when needed.


### Philosophy in practice
Flexible deadlines, emphasising qualitative feedback, encouraging vulnerability and risk-taking in their work, and demonstrating trauma informed teaching are some of the ways I practice my student-centered approach. Putting the students’ needs and expectations first allows me to provide more engaging, diverse lectures while also empowering students to be more active in their participation. In example, I like to ask student's about media they consume to develop more diverse pop culture examples. I also ask students about social causes they care about and develop examples around those causes to make material engaging. For example, I developed  datasets looking at real world data on topics such as climate change and police brutality for students to apply their communication statistics skills they learned in class. Students analyzed the data while learning basic excel skills.

Being responsive and open-minded to student’s needs has helped my students to enjoy the course more. Their enjoyment is made evident through their positive end-of-semester evaluations from my class. Another indicator of my teaching effectiveness is that even when attendance is not required, nearly all my students attend class and form strong bonds with each other and me. Students I have taught have gone on to win awards in my department, even referencing their experiences in my class as a reason they love communication as a major. One of my other points of teaching related pride is that I have written 4 letters of recommendation for students going on to graduate school, and several more letters in support of students applying to various scholarships. 

### Goals

These experiences have been rewarding and I plan to continue improving my teaching by creating more inclusive environments and curriculums, and supporting students in their academic pursuits.

### Resources I've used for better understanding decolonization
These are some resources that have helped me re-think what an inclusive classroom means and my role in creating that space. First and foremost, decolonizing means
land back. Land back and classroom inclusiveness is particularly poignant at land-grant universities like MSU. To better understand the role that land grant
universities continue to play in colonization, please see the Land Grab project here: [https://www.landgrabu.org/](https://www.landgrabu.org/)
