<p>I am a PhD candidate looking for an industry job to continue doing hands-on research with teams I love. Want to know more or chat about research, graduate school, mental health, or something else? Email me anytime at wilcox54@msu.edu.

<p> My primary research interest is in identifying differences in health message effects on memory, particularly in interpersonal contexts, and leveraging those differences to increase message effectiveness and decrease negative side effects of prescriptive messages.
