---
My name is Shelby Wilcox. I'm a graduate student of the Department of Communication, Michigan State University. 
I focus on how social factors influence message processing and how message processing predicts memory and behaviors. I am interested in studying messages across contexts such as social media posts, narratives, health campaigns, and interpersonal conversations.

During my undergraduate career, I was able to work under incredible mentors and developed a love for research. That passion has driven me to pursue a career where I can spend my life pursuing my research interests, collaborating with different scholars, and mentoring future researchers.

My short term goals are to continue developing my programming skills (specifically R & Python), learn more statistical and machine-learning tools to analyze brain data, and successfully propose my pre-lim!

I am always looking to collaborate and work with other graduate students/ early career researchers! If you have stumbled across this page and are interested in chatting more, please contact me!

If you're wondering what I do outside of academia, here are a few things:
1. Spending time with my dog, Kona.
2. Finding ways to reduce my waste and be more eco-friendly!
3. Getting involved with campus or community work.
